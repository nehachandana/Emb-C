# **Requirements**
## Introduction
Seat Heating Application is used to control a car's seat temperature. It gives pleasant warmth for a period of time. It is very useful for those who suffer from back pain, especially on long trips. The temprature is initially detected and according to our need, the temperature can be increaed or decreased. The same would be displayed.

## ACTIVITY-1:

In Activity-1, we check if driver is seated on seat.

## ACTIVITY-2:

In Activity-2 temperature of the seat is detected. The temperature can be increased or decreased.

## ACTIVITY-3:

In Activity-3 it displays the temperature of the seat as output.


  # SWOT Analysis
  ## Strengths
  1) It is helpful for people suffering with backpain. 2) Temperature can be changed according to our requirement. 3)Easy to implement 4) cost effective

  
  ## Weakness
  1) It may not be implemented in all cars.

  ## Opportunities
  1) Implemented by all vehicles.

  ## Threats 
  1)Malfunctioning of this project may occur.
